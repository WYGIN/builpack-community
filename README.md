Welcome to the CNB community! We're happy to have you.

This document is an entry-point for joining and contributing to the CNB community, be it through improving documentation, code, etc.

## Communication

We meet twice weekly on Zoom. WG meetings. We need to work out the details of moderation in order to publish those meetings widely. https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/zoom-guidelines.md#setting-up-your-meeting-and-moderation might be a good place to start

For more day-to-day communications, we use [Slack](https://slack.buildpacks.io/).

## Contributing

The [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:

1. How to file an issue
2. How to find something to work on
3. How to open a pull request
