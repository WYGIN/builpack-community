# Maintainer's Guide

This table aims to provide insight into the role of a CNB Maintainer. The examples given are for the [Implementation Team](https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#implementation-team), and are intended as suggestions (not mandates!). Note that Project Contributors can take on any of the actions listed here, except for the last 3 rows. Thus the road to becoming a maintaner often includes inhabiting the role before assuming the title. For more information, see the [governance](https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers) page.
